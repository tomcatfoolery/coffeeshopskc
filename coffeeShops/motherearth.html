        <h1>Mother Earth Coffee Shop</h1>
        <p><em>Seating</em> is what this coffee house is built for. The long bar top in the middle of the house has outlets <strong>running the length of it</strong>; perfect for getting some work done. It’s also sporting several comfy arm chairs with a feux fireplace behind, and there are plenty of tables and chairs throughout the rest of the area. They have a community events board for those looking to get a beat on what the buzz is in KC. Make sure to ask someone behind the counter for the key to the bathroom that’s located around the corner outside the shop (but still in the larger building).
