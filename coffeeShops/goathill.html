        <h1>Goat Hill Coffee & Soda</h1>
        <p>I love the neighborhood this little shop is in (and I mean <em>little</em>), and I loved the people behind the counter. Problem is, well, I already said it. There’s no space to work at any of its 5-6 spots set up for seating. There is one, though, and it’s facing the <strong>north window</strong>. If it’s taken, you’re out of luck. And their prices were a little too high, in my opinion. The breakfast burrito and cucumber/mint infused soda were tasty, though.
