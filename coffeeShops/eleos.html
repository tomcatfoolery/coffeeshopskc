        <h1>Eleos Coffee House</h1>
        <p>Forget pretentious prices when patronizing this gem in Northeast Kansas City. I got a <strong>loaded grilled cheese sandwich with a side of potato salad for $7.50 plus tax</strong>. Sure beats paying $8 for a cucumber/mint infused soda. The west-facing window has a delightfully spacious work area with a <em>power strip</em> on top for convenient access. There is plenty of seating with 3 different types–a middle area with tables and chairs, a booth-type set up against the east wall, and the west-facing work area I mentioned above. I received a $10 gift card, so I checked this place out, and I’m happy I did.</p>
